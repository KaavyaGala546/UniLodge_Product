## Architecture Overview

UniLodge v2 follows a **layered monorepo architecture** with a decoupled AI engine. All three applications communicate over HTTP/REST and share a common TypeScript type package.

```
Client (Browser)
    │
    │  HTTPS
    ▼
Frontend — Next.js 14                    (port 3000)
    │
    │  REST API  ·  JWT Bearer Token
    ▼
Backend API — Express.js                 (port 5000)
    ├── MongoDB        (document storage)
    └── PostgreSQL     (analytics & transactional data)

AI Engine — Express.js                   (port 3002)
    └── OpenRouter API (LLM inference — chat, pricing, recommendations)
```

### Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Authentication** | JWT-based login and registration with role enforcement |
| **Room Management** | Search, availability tracking, warden-managed listings |
| **Booking Workflow** | Request → Approval → Payment → Check-in → Check-out |
| **Payment Processing** | Stripe-integrated payment and refund handling |
| **AI Chat** | RAG-enabled assistant for students, wardens, and admins |
| **Price Suggestions** | ML-driven pricing recommendations with market analysis |
| **Notifications** | In-app alerts and transactional email via SendGrid |
| **Reviews** | Post-stay room ratings and written feedback |

### User Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| **Guest / Student** | Browse rooms, submit bookings, make payments, chat with AI |
| **Warden** | Manage room listings, approve bookings, process check-ins |
| **Administrator** | Platform oversight, analytics, warden management, room approvals |

## Visual Diagrams

All diagrams are located in [`diagrams/diagram-images/`](./diagrams/diagram-images/) and are organized by category.

### Use Case Diagrams

### Entity-Relationship Diagrams

Represent the database schema across both MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `er/01-core-identity.png` | User authentication and profile schema |
| `er/02-rooms.png` | Room listings and availability schema |
| `er/03-bookings.png` | Booking records and payment schema |
| `er/04-messaging.png` | Chat messages and notifications schema |

### Sequence Diagrams

Trace end-to-end flows through the system for each key operation.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `sequence/01-auth-register.png` | New user registration flow |
| `sequence/02-auth-login.png` | User login and token issuance |
| `sequence/03-booking-search.png` | Room search with AI-assisted recommendations |
| `sequence/04-booking-create.png` | Booking creation and warden notification |

## Contributing to Docs

When submitting changes that affect documented behaviour:

- **Architecture changes** → Update [SYSTEM_DESIGN.md](./SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) and regenerate relevant diagrams.
- **New or modified endpoints** → Update [API_REFERENCE.md](./API_REFERENCE.md) with the full request/response schema.
- **Environment or setup changes** → Reflect updates in [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md).
- **AI configuration changes** → Update [AI_ENGINE_SETUP.md](./AI_ENGINE_SETUP.md).
- **New user flows** → Add a sequence diagram to `diagrams/` and link it in [SYSTEM_DESIGN.md](./SYSTEM_DESIGN.md).

All documentation is written in Markdown and rendered by GitHub. Keep line lengths reasonable and prefer tables over long bullet lists where structure aids readability.
